# Bubble Sort ‍✨

Welcome to **Bubble Sort**, where we bring order to chaos one swap at a time! This project is all about implementing the classic **bubble sort algorithm** in Ruby. It's simple, processor-intensive, and a fundamental building block of Computer Science. 🖥️💡

## What's Bubble Sort? 

Bubble sort is a straightforward way to sort an array by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and swapping them if they're out of order. This process repeats until everything is in perfect ascending order. Think of it as repeatedly "bubbling" the largest item to the end of the array. 🛁💭

### How It Works:

1. Compare two adjacent elements.
2. Swap them if the left one is larger than the right one.
3. Repeat until the array is sorted.

## Why It Matters

Sorting algorithms like bubble sort might seem simple, but they're a great way to learn **algorithm design**, **time complexity**, and **iteration patterns**. Plus, they're the foundation for understanding more complex sorting techniques. 🚀
